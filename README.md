## 🚀 How to Use Locally

### HTML-only (no PHP logic)
1. Open any `.html` or `.php` file directly in your browser (only for static visual test)

### PHP (fully functional includes)
1. Install a local server like **[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)** or use `php -S`:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
2. Access the site at `http://localhost/your-folder`
