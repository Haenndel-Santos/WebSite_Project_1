remain in effect for thirty (30) days after the date of xxx's quotation, xxx scope of work or acknowledgment of Buyer's
order for the Services and Products, whichever occurs first, provided an unconditional authorization from Buyer for the
performance of the Services and Products is received and accepted by xxx within such time period. If authorization is
not received by xxx within such thirty (30) day period, xxx shall have the right to change the price for the Services and
Products. All prices are exclusive of taxes, which are to be borne by Buyer. Unless otherwise specified by xxx, all Services

                <h2>2. Taxes</h2>
                <p>[Any current or future tax or governmental charge (or increase in same) affecting xxx's costs of Services or costs of
production, sale, delivery or shipment of Products, or which xxx is otherwise required to pay or collect in connection
with the provision of Services and Products, shall be for Buyer's account and shall be added to the price or billed to

                <h2>3. Terms of Payment</h2>
                <p>[Unless otherwise specified by xxx, terms of payment are thirty (30) days from date of xxx's invoice in currency specified
by xxx. xxx shall have the right, among other remedies, either to terminate this Agreement or to suspend further
performance under this Agreement and/or other agreement with Buyer in the event Buyer is or in xxx reasonable
opinion Buyer is likely to become in default with payment under this Agreement or any other agreement and under the
same conditions require reasonable security for payment or advance payment for future Services and all other confirmed
Service and Product orders not yet rendered. Buyer shall be liable for all expenses, including attorneys' fees, relating to
the collection of past due amounts. If any payment owed to xxx is not paid when due, it shall bear interest, at a rate in
accordance with applicable law from the date on which it is due until it is paid.]</p>
            </section>
            <section id="clause-4">
    <h2>4. Shipment and Delivery</h2>
    <p>WhiWhile xxx will use all reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the performance dates acknowledged or quoted by
xxx, all performance dates are approximate and not guaranteed. xxx, at its option, shall not be bound to tender delivery
of any Products for which Buyer has not provided shipping instructions and other required information. If the provision
of Services or shipment of the Products is postponed or delayed by Buyer for any reason, Buyer agrees to reimburse
xxx for any and all storage costs and other additional expenses resulting therefrom. Any and all costs for delivery are
for the Buyer. Notwithstanding the above, risk of loss and legal title to Products shall transfer to Buyer (i) when delivered
by the individual providing the Services, or (ii) at the time Products are placed in storage due to Buyer’s delay or
postponement. Any claims for shortages or damages suffered in transit are the responsibility of Buyer and shall be
submitted by Buyer directly to the carrier.
Without receipt by xxx of a written notice or a stamped return receipt within two (2) weeks after delivery, Products
delivered to Buyer on trial are deemed to be delivered definitively. xxx will not take back any Product (supplied on trial)
that has been treated or manipulated in any manner by Buyer. In the event xxx provides any goods to Buyer in
connection with the execution of the Agreement, xxx shall remain owner of such goods. Buyer will take the utmost care
of such goods. This means among other things that the Buyer shall refrain from any conduct that may lead to loss of
those goods (for example by specification, accession, amalgamation or otherwise), or taxation or encumbrance with
rights of third parties, or damages of such goods. Buyer shall insure such goods, mentioned in the previous two
sentences, at its own expense under the usual conditions against any damage arising as a result of total or partial loss
or damage, irrespective of the cause. Buyer shall use these goods at its own risk, for the purpose for which they were
made available. This means among other things that xxx is not liable for damages – in any form and for whatever reason
– which the Buyer sustains as a result of use, unless the damage is a result of intentional or deliberate recklessness of
xxx.</p>

<section id="clause-5">
    <h2>5. Liability for Defects</h2>
    <p>Subject to the limitations of section 6, xxx warrants that it will perform the Services and design the Products as described
in this Agreement and will exercise all reasonable skill, care and due diligence in the performance of the Services and
shall perform the Services in accordance with professional practice. Minimal, in the industry or technically unavoidable
deviations in quality, color, size or finish are not considered to be a defect and are not grounds for rescission or damages.
xxx warrants that all Services and/or Products performed shall be free from all defects in workmanship for a period of
ninety (90) days from completion of Services and/or Products. To the extent assignable, xxx assigns to Buyer any
warranties that are made by manufacturers and suppliers of Products. The sole and exclusive remedy for breach of

negligence (other than xxx's), unauthorized modification or alteration, use beyond rated capacity, unsuitable power
sources or environmental conditions, improper installation, repair, handling, maintenance or application or any other
cause not the fault of xxx. To the extent that Buyer or its agents have supplied specifications, information, representation
of operating conditions or other data to xxx that is used in (i) the selection and execution of the Services and/or Products
and (ii) the preparation of xxx's quotation and/or scope of work, and in the event that actual operating conditions or
other conditions differ from those represented by Buyer, any warranties or other provisions contained herein that are
affected by such conditions shall be null and void.
Buyer assumes all other responsibility for any loss, damage, or injury to persons or property arising out of, connected
with, or resulting from the use of Services or Products, either alone or in combination with other Products.</p>

exports or the failure to grant or the revocation of applicable export licenses); unavailability of or delays in transportation;
default of suppliers; or unforeseen circumstances or any events or causes beyond xxx's reasonable control. Performance
of Services and deliveries of Products may be suspended for an appropriate period of time or canceled by xxx upon
notice to Buyer in the event of any of the foregoing, but the balance of this Agreement shall otherwise remain unaffected
as a result of the foregoing.
If xxx determines that its ability to supply the total demand for the Services or Products or to obtain material used
directly or indirectly in the manufacture of the Products is hindered, limited or made impracticable due to causes set
forth in the preceding paragraph, xxx may delay performance of Services or allocate its available supply of the Products
among its purchasers on such basis as xxx determines to be equitable without liability for any failure of performance
which may result therefrom.

<section id="clause12">
    <h2>12. Inspection</h2>
    <p>Buyer may subject the Services and Products within ten (10) days from the date of completion of each part of the Services or Products to an inspection. In case of nonconformity Purchaser shall so indicate in writing by xxx. This report must contain a detailed description of the defect, so xxx is able to and react adequately. Buyer must grant xxx the opportunity to investigate the complaint. If the Buyer’s complaint is submitted timely and it is shown that such defects or failures are attributable to xxx in the fulfillment of its existing obligations towards the Buyer, xxx will – at its discretion – arrange for free repair or replacement of the products. Complaints by the Buyer do not suspend its payment obligation. In that case Buyer remains obliged to accept and pay for the ordered Services and Products. In the absence of this notification, the Buyer shall be deemed to have been accepted the Services or Products unconditionally.
    Termination of the Agreement by the Buyer is only possible to the extent that xxx is not able to eliminate or repair the shortcomings or defects. In case of replacement, the Buyer is obliged to return the initial Product to xxx and grant xxx possession, unless indicated otherwise by xxx.</p>

A termination as set out in this article will not result in a termination of the rights of xxx, which by their nature are designed, in the reasonable judgment of xxx, to continue in full force and effect after the termination.</p>
